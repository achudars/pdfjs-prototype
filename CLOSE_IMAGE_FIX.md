# Close Image Fix Test

## Issue Fixed

The "Close Image" button was not properly clearing the currently previewed image.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Dedicated Close Image Function

```javascript
// Added explicit alias for closing images
const closeImage = resetAppState;
```

### 2. Updated Image Controls

```javascript
// Changed from closePdf to closeImage for semantic clarity
{
  fileType === "image" && (
    <div className="pdf-controls">
      <button onClick={closeImage} className="close-btn">
        Close Image
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 3. Comprehensive State Reset

The `resetAppState` function now ensures ALL state is cleared:

- ✅ `setCurrentFile(null)` - Clears the current image
- ✅ `setNumPages(null)` - Clears page count (not applicable to images but ensures clean state)
- ✅ `setPageNumber(1)` - Resets page number
- ✅ `setFileMetadata(null)` - Clears image metadata
- ✅ `setFileType(null)` - Clears file type
- ✅ `setError(null)` - Clears any error messages

## Test Steps

1. Open the application at http://localhost:5173
2. Upload an image file (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, or SVG)
3. Verify the image displays with metadata
4. Click the "Close Image" button
5. Verify that:
   - ✅ The image disappears completely
   - ✅ The interface returns to the drop zone
   - ✅ Image metadata is cleared
   - ✅ No error messages remain
   - ✅ Ready to accept new file uploads

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ "Close Image" button should completely clear the current image
- ✅ Interface should return to initial upload state
- ✅ No residual image data or metadata should remain
- ✅ Ready for new file upload immediately

## Verification

The fix ensures that image closing works identically to PDF closing, providing consistent user experience across all file types.
