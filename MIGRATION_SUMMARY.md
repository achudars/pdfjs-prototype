# Yarn to npm Migration Summary

## ✅ Migration Completed Successfully

This project has been successfully migrated from Yarn to npm. All Yarn-related files and configurations have been removed, and the project is now fully using npm.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Yarn Files

- ✅ Deleted `yarn.lock` file
- ✅ Removed `.yarn/` directory (including cache and unplugged)
- ✅ No `.yarnrc` or yarn configuration files found

### 2. Updated .gitignore

The `.gitignore` file already included proper Yarn exclusions:

```gitignore
# Yarn directories and cache
.yarn/
.yarn/cache
.yarn/unplugged
.yarn/build-state.yml
.yarn/install-state.gz
.pnp.*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
```

### 3. Verified npm Usage

- ✅ `package.json` uses npm scripts (no Yarn-specific scripts)
- ✅ `package-lock.json` is present and up-to-date
- ✅ `README.md` exclusively uses npm commands
- ✅ No Yarn references in project documentation

## Package Manager Verification

### npm Version

```
npm: 9.4.1
```

### Available Scripts (npm-based)

```json
{
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "test": "vitest",
  "test:run": "vitest run",
  "test:ui": "vitest --ui",
  "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
  "postinstall": "copyfiles -f node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.mjs public/ && cp public/pdf.worker.min.mjs public/pdf.worker.min.js"
}
```

## Testing Status

### ✅ All Tests Pass After Migration

- **Total Tests**: 18/18 passing (100% success rate)
- **Test Suites**: 2/2 passing
- **Unit Tests**: 11 tests covering core functionality
- **Integration Tests**: 7 tests with real test files

### Test Categories

1. **Initial Render** - UI components and layout
2. **PDF File Loading** - PDF upload, metadata, navigation
3. **Image File Loading** - Image upload, metadata, formats
4. **File Validation** - Drag-and-drop, error handling
5. **Worker Setup** - PDF.js worker verification
6. **Integration** - Real file testing

## Build Verification

### ✅ Production Build Successful

```bash
npm run build
# ✓ built in 1.96s
# dist/index.html  2.42 kB │ gzip:   1.00 kB
# dist/assets/index-D5iuaccC.css 14.65 kB │ gzip:   3.42 kB
# dist/assets/index-pWguMC2m.js  526.05 kB │ gzip: 159.45 kB
```

## Project Commands

### Development

```bash
npm install          # Install dependencies
npm run dev         # Start development server
npm run build       # Build for production
npm run preview     # Preview production build
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test           # Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:run   # Run tests once
npm run test:ui    # Run tests with UI
npm run test:coverage  # Run with coverage report
```

## Migration Benefits

1. **Simplified Package Management**: Single package manager (npm)
2. **Reduced File Clutter**: No more `yarn.lock` and `.yarn/` directory
3. **Consistent Tooling**: All team members use npm
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All features continue to work perfectly
5. **Test Coverage**: Complete test suite passes without issues

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Yarn Removal**: Complete
2. ✅ **npm Verification**: Working correctly
3. ✅ **Test Validation**: All tests passing
4. ✅ **Build Verification**: Production build successful
5. ✅ **Documentation**: Updated and consistent

## Important Notes

- **Lock File**: Only `package-lock.json` remains (npm's lock file)
- **Dependencies**: All packages work correctly with npm
- **Scripts**: All npm scripts function as expected
- **Worker Setup**: PDF.js worker setup continues to work
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite validates all functionality

The project is now fully migrated to npm and ready for development and production use.
