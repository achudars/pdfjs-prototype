# Close PDF Fix Test

## Issue

The "Close PDF" button was not properly clearing all the application state, specifically:

- Page number wasn't reset to 1
- Total page count (numPages) wasn't cleared
- Error state wasn't cleared

## Fix Applied

Updated the `closePdf` and `tryAnotherFile` functions to reset ALL relevant state variables:

```javascript
const resetAppState = (e) => {
  e?.stopPropagation();
  setCurrentFile(null); // ✅ Clear current file
  setNumPages(null); // ✅ Clear page count
  setPageNumber(1); // ✅ Reset to page 1
  setFileMetadata(null); // ✅ Clear metadata
  setFileType(null); // ✅ Clear file type
  setError(null); // ✅ Clear any errors
};
```

## Test Steps

1. Open the application at http://localhost:5173
2. Upload a PDF file (use any PDF from the test folder)
3. Navigate to page 2 or higher using the navigation buttons
4. Click "Close PDF" button
5. Upload the same or different PDF again
6. Verify that:
   - The PDF starts at page 1 (not the previous page)
   - Page controls show "Page 1 of X" correctly
   - No error messages are displayed
   - File metadata is fresh

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ PDF viewer should completely reset to initial state
- ✅ Page number should always start at 1 for new files
- ✅ No residual state from previous files
- ✅ Clean slate for each new file upload

## Verification

The fix consolidates duplicate code and ensures consistent state management across the application.
