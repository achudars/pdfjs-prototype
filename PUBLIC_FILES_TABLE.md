# Public Files Table Implementation

## Summary

Successfully added a PublicFilesTable component to the PDF & Image Viewer application that displays sample files from the public directory.

## Features Implemented

### 1. PublicFilesTable Component (`src/components/PublicFilesTable.jsx`)

- Displays a clean table with file information
- Shows two sample files:
  - `2025_05_25_10_03_IMG_0949.JPG` (Image)
  - `Migration of Birds, Frederick C. Lincoln.pdf` (PDF)
- Each row contains:
  - File name
  - File type (Image/PDF)
  - Download button (📥) - downloads the file
  - Preview button (👁️) - loads the file into the viewer above

### 2. Styling (`style.css`)

- Added comprehensive CSS styles for the table
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Hover effects and smooth transitions
- Action buttons with different colors for download vs preview
- Consistent with the existing dark theme

### 3. Integration (`src/App.jsx`)

- Added the component to the main App
- Connected to the existing `handleFileSelect` function for previews
- Positioned at the bottom of the interface

## User Interactions

1. **Download**: Click the 📥 icon to download the file directly
2. **Preview**: Click the 👁️ icon to load the file into the viewer above (same as drag-and-drop)
