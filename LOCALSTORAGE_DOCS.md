# Local Storage Implementation for PDF & Image Viewer

## Overview

The PDF & Image Viewer now includes comprehensive local storage functionality that automatically saves uploaded files to the browser's localStorage and provides a user-friendly interface to manage and reopen previously uploaded files.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Automatic File Storage

- **All uploaded files** (both PDFs and images) are automatically saved to localStorage
- Files are stored as **base64-encoded data** with complete metadata
- **No duplicate storage** - files with the same name and size won't be saved twice
- **Metadata preservation** - all extracted PDF/image metadata is stored along with the file

### ‚úÖ Persistent File Library

- **Persistent across browser sessions** - files remain available after closing and reopening the browser
- **Smart sorting** - files are sorted by last opened date (most recent first)
- **File count display** - shows total number of stored files
- **Upload and access timestamps** - tracks when files were uploaded and last accessed

### ‚úÖ User-Friendly Interface

- **Collapsible file list** - toggle visibility with "Show Files" / "Hide Files" button
- **Rich file information** - displays file type, size, upload date, and last opened date
- **Quick access** - one-click to reopen any stored file
- **Individual file deletion** - delete specific files from storage
- **Bulk deletion** - clear all stored files with one click

### ‚úÖ File Management

- **File type icons** - visual indicators for PDFs (üìÑ) and images (üñºÔ∏è)
- **File size formatting** - human-readable file sizes (KB, MB, GB)
- **Metadata restoration** - all original metadata is restored when reopening files
- **Error handling** - graceful handling of storage errors and corrupted data

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structure

Each stored file contains:

```javascript
{
  id: "unique_timestamp_id",
  name: "filename.pdf",
  type: "application/pdf",
  size: 1234567,
  fileType: "pdf" | "image",
  data: "data:application/pdf;base64,JVBERi0xLjQ...", // Base64 data
  metadata: { /* extracted PDF/image metadata */ },
  uploadDate: "2025-06-29T12:00:00.000Z",
  lastOpened: "2025-06-29T12:30:00.000Z"
}
```

### Storage Methods

- **saveFileToStorage()** - Converts files to base64 and stores with metadata
- **loadStoredFiles()** - Retrieves all stored files from localStorage
- **loadFileFromStorage()** - Converts stored data back to File objects
- **deleteFileFromStorage()** - Removes individual files
- **clearAllStoredFiles()** - Removes all stored files

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern browsers** - Full support for localStorage and base64 encoding
- **Storage limits** - Automatically handles localStorage size constraints
- **Error recovery** - Graceful fallback if localStorage is unavailable

## User Experience

### First Time Usage

1. Upload a PDF or image file (drag & drop or click to browse)
2. File is automatically processed and saved to localStorage
3. File appears in the viewer with full functionality

### Returning User Experience

1. Open the application
2. See "üìÇ Previously Uploaded Files (X)" section with file count
3. Click "üìÇ Show Files" to expand the file list
4. Click "üìÇ Open" on any file to instantly reload it
5. All metadata and viewing state is restored

### File Management

- **Individual deletion**: Click üóëÔ∏è next to any file
- **Bulk deletion**: Click "üóëÔ∏è Clear All" to remove all files
- **Storage monitoring**: File sizes and dates help manage storage usage

## Storage Considerations

### Performance

- **Efficient encoding** - Uses native browser base64 encoding
- **Lazy loading** - Files are only converted when needed
- **Memory management** - Large files are handled efficiently

### Storage Limits

- **Browser limits** - Typically 5-10MB per domain for localStorage
- **File size monitoring** - Large files are stored but may hit browser limits
- **User feedback** - Clear error messages if storage fails

### Privacy & Security

- **Local only** - All data remains in the user's browser
- **No server upload** - Files never leave the user's device
- **User control** - Users can delete files at any time

## File Type Support

### PDF Files

- ‚úÖ Full PDF.js integration
- ‚úÖ Metadata extraction (title, author, pages, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Page navigation state preservation
- ‚úÖ All PDF.js features work with stored files

### Image Files

- ‚úÖ Support for JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG
- ‚úÖ Metadata extraction (dimensions, file size, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Original quality preservation
- ‚úÖ Responsive image display

## Usage Tips

### Best Practices

1. **Monitor storage usage** - Large files consume more localStorage space
2. **Regular cleanup** - Delete files you no longer need
3. **File organization** - Files are sorted by last opened for easy access
4. **Backup important files** - localStorage can be cleared by browser settings

### Troubleshooting

- **Storage full**: Clear some files or browser data
- **File won't load**: Try deleting and re-uploading the file
- **Missing files**: Check if browser data was cleared
- **Performance issues**: Clear all stored files and restart

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- [ ] **Search functionality** - Find files by name or type
- [ ] **Export/Import** - Download stored files or import from device
- [ ] **Storage statistics** - Detailed storage usage information
- [ ] **File tags** - User-defined tags for better organization
- [ ] **Compression** - Reduce storage size for large files

### Technical Improvements

- [ ] **IndexedDB migration** - For larger storage capacity
- [ ] **Chunked storage** - Handle very large files
- [ ] **Background processing** - Non-blocking file operations
- [ ] **Service worker** - Offline functionality

## Browser Support

| Feature         | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Edge |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------ | ---- |
| localStorage    | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ     | ‚úÖ   |
